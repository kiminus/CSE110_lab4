1. for example, the debugging problem shows the uncontrolibiilty of loose typing. and it is easy to get weird answer when type mismatch instead of getting an exception telling you where it is wrong. For example, if the accessing property is undefined and you try to add its value, it would add a 0, which does not throw an exception.
2. I dont understand why it is loose typed, but I think the reason it is asynchronous derives from its primary design of web development language, since the graphic update of a website is naturally asynchronous due to all the interaction with network and user interaction
3. compiled lanaguage are those where the source codes translate to machine code first then execute, while interpreted language are executed by the interpreter in place at runtime. Javascript is therefore a interpreted language because it does not go through the compiler first. However, some of the javascript libraries are also precompiled to boost efficiency. Advantage of interpreted language includes good portability and loose tracking, so there is more freedom to write the code, however, interpret code in place at real time adds extra workload and therefore reduce performance
4. because vanilla JS are fundamentals
5. JS is the fundamental piece of advanced, dynamic and interative web. It enables the team to go from static web to dynamic web.
